# ðŸŒ­ Joe's Hotdog Stand

**Joe's Hotdog Stand** is a mock website project built to practice the fundamentals of **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

## Features

- Prompt-based input for ordering hotdogs, fries, and sodas  
- Automatic calculation and display of a receipt  
- Rounded pricing using a custom JavaScript function  
- Simple, clean layout styled with CSS  

## How It Works

When you open the page, you'll be prompted to enter the quantity of each item you'd like to order. The site will then display a formatted receipt showing item totals and overall cost.
